<!--
Boilerplate code: This is a standard boilerplate code
This is a code template that will be reused for different projects

first line:
the document type is declared
when file is open tells the browser what version of html that is being used

tells the browser to render file as html5 document

Structure and appearance of code will slightly change depending on the doctype

docs.emmet.io: gives the shortcuts

html: tells the browser everything between the opening and closing tag is going to be html code

code
consists head and body

head: section that holds info about the webpage and tells browser how it should handle the page
title tag: tells the title of the particular page

ways of opening up the website:
opening the html tag directly
right click on file then copy file path

meta element:
this one in particular is called character set

when we are setting it to is utf-8
telling browser all text inside the webpage is encodes using utf-8 coding system

sometimes the characters are rendered in a gibberish language (this is called mojibake)
This occurs when browser is rendering characters using the wrong character set

utf-8 includes all international symbols (and every symbol included in the unicode char set)


other attributes for the meta element
description
keyword
author
tells browser how it should render or display webpage
Furthermore gives information to search engines about the contents of the website


indentation is important, to show which tags are inside other ones

<p>: formats tag into a paragraph; they get a newline, text inside tag gets group together into the same paragraph


emphasis: use to confer meaning to a piece of text rather than styling
same goes for strong tag (but this makes the text bold)

how to make bullet points:
<ul>: which stands for unordered list
ordered list: instead of bullets points will have a sequence like 1,2,3 or a,b,c

<ul>: encloses all parts that will be included in the bullet list
<li>: encloses each bullet points


image elemnt:
self-closing tag
specify source of the image
can be url
or file as same directory as your webbsite
alternative: if the browser can't find the file then it will use this as an alternative
when browser comes across image tag, it has ping to servers of the host website to obtain this image,
if the host's website is down then image is no longer available at the source

anchor tags

hypertext is a bunch of text documents that can be linked together using these hyperlinks
components in hyperlink tag
<html element href attribute>link text (word highlighted in blue)</a>
href - points to the destination of the hyperlink
you can link to a new html page by using the file name in href (if you are in the same directory)

----------------
Tables

They can have headers, bodies, and footers

Putting the table row that contains the table header cell element inside the main table will make no difference
as when you are putting that row inside the header

This is because we are using table header elements and most browsers know how they should be formatted
so it looks the same

however having different sections is import since maybe we want to design the table header and body to have different
functions of styles

some attributes are deprecated (in mdn they have a thumbs down), this means that it is downgraded, and it is not
recommended to be used
(Basically not recommended to style stuff using html)

td - represents table cells or data
tr - table rows

you can also do a nested table to have tables within tables
