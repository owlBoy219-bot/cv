<!--
Getting a form so that people will allow to put down their name and email

you can add different inputs as well by changing the input type:
text: gives you textbox
color: allows you to choose the color
checkbox: gives you a checkbox
submit: gives you a submit button
password: whatever you type is masked

form tag: is just to define the form
label tag: text that will be displayed as a label

textarea: basically defines a text field that could be expanded or contracted
furthermore it has two attributes rows and cols which will define the starting width and height


from
action: mail (submit opens default mail client and puts in the email address that you specify after the colon)
method: post (basically transfers what you put into the input field into the clients email)

email type is cool because the box makes sure that you are filling a valid email
name attribute basically classify each piece of the data

How to hose your website:
one method is using github
+ > new repository (repository is a project on the cloud that will store all your project related files)
select:
public
readme
create repository

upload file to the repository
give the version a name then commit changes

setting tabs > pages > none> main as your branch >

must have a file called index.html because github will consider this as your homepage
doctype html sometimes shows up at the top of your website (this could be deleted)
